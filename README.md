# One-sample-t-test-in-R-programming

We created a demo dataset to solve a real life problem using one sample t test. <br>
We used r programming in this task. <br>
## **Problem Statement** <br>
We organized an exhibition showcasing 30 artworks, split between AI-generated and human-created pieces. Among the 75 guests invited, the challenge was for them to determine which artworks belonged to each category. Our goal is to analyze if their guesses differed significantly from what would be expected by a random 50/50 chance.
